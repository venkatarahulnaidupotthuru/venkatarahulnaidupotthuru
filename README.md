# 👋 Hi, I’m Rahul Naidu
### Computer Science (Data Science) • Python Engineer

I build at the intersection of **data intelligence** and **system reliability**. I enjoy transforming raw data into actionable insights and wrapping them in clean, efficient Python-based backends. 

Whether it's optimizing a data pipeline or building a scalable API, I focus on writing code that is performant, testable, and logically sound.

### How I think about building

I believe that a model is only as good as the system it runs on. My goal is to bridge the gap between **research** and **production** by ensuring that data-driven solutions are modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.
